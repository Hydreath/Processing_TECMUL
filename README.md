# Infinite Runner
This small game was made for the TECMUL university units' 1st practical assignment. The objective of the game is to get the maximum amount of points possible. The game is inspired by the "Outrun" aesthetic.

## Controlls
The game is controlled by camera motion and functions similarly to the Playstation 2 Eye Toy, move on the sides to turn and stay in the middle to go forward. Making noise will affect your speed.
